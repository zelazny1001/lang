11,this_one_is_for_sheet3_summary,ba,"I am writing to formally complain about the unacceptable service I received at your restaurant last night. I had chosen your establishment for a special occasion, hoping for a memorable and enjoyable evening, but it turned into a frustrating and disappointing experience. From the outset, the service was abysmal. We were greeted by a hostess who seemed disinterested and unwelcoming. She directed us to our table without a smile or a word of welcome. Our table was located in a dark and cramped corner of the restaurant, and it was covered in crumbs from the previous diners. It took an excessive amount of time for our server to approach us, and when he finally did, he was brusque and impatient. He seemed annoyed when we asked questions about the menu and rushed us to place our orders. The drinks we ordered were poorly made and watered down. My cocktail was missing several ingredients, and my companion's wine was served at the wrong temperature. The appetizers we ordered were mediocre at best. The calamari was rubbery and the bruschetta was soggy. The main courses arrived at different times, with some members of our party receiving their meals while others were still waiting. My fish was overcooked and the side dish was cold. My friend's steak was undercooked and the sauce was bland. The server never checked back to see if our meals were satisfactory, and we had to actively seek him out to request additional drinks and condiments. When we finished our meals, our plates sat on the table for an extended period of time before they were cleared. The server never offered us dessert, and we had to ask for the check. The check was presented to us with a scowl, and the server seemed eager to get rid of us. The entire service experience was rushed, inattentive, and unprofessional. The food quality was inconsistent and the overall atmosphere was lacking in warmth and hospitality. I am extremely disappointed with the level of service I received, and I expected much more from a restaurant of your reputation. I strongly urge you to address these issues to improve the dining experience for future customers.",i45,the main courses seemed to arrive,TRUE
